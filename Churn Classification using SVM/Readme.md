# 🧠 Customer Churn Classification — Support Vector Machine

This version applies an SVM classifier with a linear kernel to separate churned and non-churned customers. It's designed to detect subtle patterns and maximize margin between classes.

## 💡 Highlights
- Preprocessing and scaling applied
- One-hot encoded features
- Used `SVC(kernel='linear')` for classification
- Evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
